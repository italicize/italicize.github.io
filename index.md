# Next steps after a fresh installation of Windows 10

A new computer, or a reimaged computer, often requires further setup, such as connecting to Wi-Fi, turning on Windows security, and updating Windows. My fix-ups include a few steps for security but most steps are personal customizations. 

The first step is often to adjust an external monitor. Click **Start () > Settings () > System > Display** and change the monitor settings. Close Settings (X). 

## Save a Wi-Fi password

1. Click **Start () > Settings () > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi**.
1. Turn Wi-Fi **On**.
1. Click **Show available networks.**
1. Select a network, click **Connect**, type a password, and click **Next**. 
    - If at home or work, click **Yes**. 
    - If away from home or work, click **No**.
1. Close Settings (X).
1. To change the time zone, click **Start () > Settings () > Time & Language**. Select a time zone. Close Settings (X).

## Turn on security

1. Click **Start () > Settings () > Update & Security > Windows Security**. 
1. Click **Open Windows Security**.
1. Take the recommended actions for Virus & threat protection, Account protection, and the other security categories.
    - For example, click **Virus & threat protection**. Click **Quick scan**. After the scan, take the actions recommended by Windows. If no current threats, click **Back ()**.
    - For example, click **Account protection**. Click **Set up**. Sign in with a Microsoft account. Verify your identity.
