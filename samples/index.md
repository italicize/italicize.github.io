## Writing samples

- I wrote the [help topics](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/) on my site MechanicalEdit.com.
- I wrote and formatted a [user guide](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/samples/Jay%20Martin%2C%20Sample%20User%20Guide%2C%20Demo%20App.pdf) for the marketing team at G2 Integrated Solutions. I reused procedures I had written for actual apps to make a demo for a fictitious app.
- I tested and edited a [tutorial for Docusaurus](https://web.archive.org/web/20190806204143/https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/next/tutorial-setup), a static site generator from Facebook.
