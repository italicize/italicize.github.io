## Writing samples

- I wrote the [help topics](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/) on this site, MechanicalEdit.com.
- I wrote and formatted a [user guide](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/samples/Jay%20Martin%2C%20Sample%20User%20Guide%2C%20Demo%20App.pdf) for the marketing team at G2 Integrated Solutions. I combined a few procedures I had written for actual apps to make a sample for a marketing package.
- I tested and edited the [tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20190806204143/https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/next/tutorial-setup) for Docusaurus, a static site generator from Facebook.
- I edited the []() of a lighting study.
- I edited the [energy audit](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/samples/Jay%20Martin%2C%20Sample%20Report%2C%20Energy%20Audit.pdf) of a hospital&mdash;and hundreds of other energy audits of commercial and public buildings.
- I reported the [installation errors](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/samples/Jay%20Martin%2C%20Sample%20Report%2C%20Lighting%20Problems.pdf) at a senior care facility, based the building plans and an engineer's notes of a site inspection.
- I made a simple [video introduction](https://www.mechanicaledit.com/samples/Jay%20Martin%2C%20Sample%20Video%2C%20Template%20Intro.mp4) after I set up the proposal template at G2 Integrated Solutions.
