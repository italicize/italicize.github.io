&ldquo;Q. How do you know that the document that Southern Pacific is proposing as the
1863 deed is a copy of the 1863 deed? </p><p style="padding-left:50px;">
A. I don&rsquo;t, I mean, with one hundred percent assurance, I have no way of knowing
that, any more than anybody would have any way of saying it isn&rsquo;t. There was an
1863 deed. This is one that has all the right parties, the right land, creates
the right interests, and is consistent with what was reestablished in that
judgment. It&rsquo;s identical to what was rerecorded in 1913, and at times very
close, when the parties did have things that nobody questioned. So the
possibility that it is not the true 1863 deed is almost nil.&rdquo; (<a
