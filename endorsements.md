- For example, Prop. A says "Yes" because all the groups listed said yes, even the moderate San Francisco Chronicle. 
- Prop. B says "Yes (The Chronicle says No.)" because the Bay Guardian and other progressive groups said yes, and only the Chronicle said no. 
- Prop. H is one to look at more closely, because other progressive groups said no but the SF Bike Coalition said yes. 

The descriptions of the propositions are by the Bay Guardian, such as "Business tax on CEO compensation."
